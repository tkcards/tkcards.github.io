Known bugs:
- horizontal/media view on mobile device doesn't stretch the grey to the edge, although honeslty could be good, given safe zones

- small remnants of button borders still appear on mobile, potential solution: set the bottom and right borders to the grey

- pick better resolution icon images for drink and cake

- make on click display borders not just on hover

- update favicon
