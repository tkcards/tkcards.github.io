# tkcards.github.io

Known bugs:

- low resolution icon images for drink and cake

- need to properly get rid of hover when using mobile. Look into deleting all hover, and then only rendering hover on non mobile platforms //likely problem with the @media block logic

- need to update favicon

- without wifi, the font isn't pulled from google. Look into potentially downloading the font package instead of the reference in index, and adding a second font default // not a huge issue, because wifi needed to access the site.


Todos:

- write letter, hidden behind the password

- finish the game content

- Look into scrambling the message string such that it can't be read easily on github

- update READEME.md

- refactor/comment code
